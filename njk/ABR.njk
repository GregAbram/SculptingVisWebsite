              <p class="big-paragraph">Artifact-Based Rendering (ABR) is a framework that includes tools and processes to enable
                digital visualizations to incorporate physical media. Created with artists and designers in mind, ABR is a technical
                foundation and the input channel for Sculpting Visualization’s project to enrich the visual vocabulary of scientific
                visualization through hand-crafted or naturally occurring objects. ABR bridges key barriers to incorporating artists
                and designers into visualization teams by enabling them to contribute their visual expertise without spending months
                learning software tools that currently limit the creative possibilities for their work.</p>

              </div>
              <p class="big-paragraph"> Artifact-Based Rendering is grounded in metaphors of printmaking, connecting our work in complex
                graphics processes with the practices of the artistic community. ABR layers glyphs, lines, and surfaces with color and
                shape the way a printmaker might approach image-making in their studio. </p>

              <p class="big-paragraph"> The design interface has two primary workable components:<br>
                — <b>Key Data:</b> geometric representations of your data (points, lines, surfaces), loaded from VTK unstructured grid files, each piece of
                key data has associated scalar & vector variables<br>
                — <b>Data Impressions:</b> your “layers” of data in the visualization. Apply variables and visual elements to each data impression, and
                watch as they are composed in real time in your visualization.</p>

              <p class="big-paragraph"> The user interface itself has three primary elements:<br>
                — <b>Data Palette:</b> the panel on the left-hand side which displays data impressions and loaded variables for your data.<br>
                — <b>Composition Panel:</b> the central window into which data impressions are dragged. Each set of data impressions + colormaps, glyphs,
                streamlines, etc. is called a “plate,” sticking with the printmaking metaphors. Use this panel like you would in Photoshop, adding
                visual elements as you see fit. More information on this can be found further along in this instructional guide.<br>
                — <b>Design Palette:</b> the panel on the right-hand side which displays all design options for the elements that comprise your visualization.

                is a research project that brings <a href="#">art and design theory</a> and practice to visualization. Drawing on
                the expertise of a multidisciplinary team, Sculpting Visualization describes an ethos, a set of technical tools and
                interfaces, and resources to advance data visualization via 3D, augmented reality, virtual reality, and data
                physicalization technology.</p>

                This capability includes expanding the visual vocabulary of scientific visualization—redefining the visual components
                used in data representations in a shift toward human- and nature-made glyphs, textures, lines and colors. This shift
                shortens the distance between data and the natural phenomena they represent and opens new possibilities for visually
                distinguishing and communicating intra-variate dynamics in complex visualizations.</p>

                  Generating dynamic vis assets for use in our ABR program may be a barrier for artists unfamiliar with programming architectures.
                  We created a series of Applets—ColorLoom, Infinite Line, Glyph Aligner, and Texture Mapper—to facilitate asset creation and easy import in ABR.

                  dynamic starting point, and allows them to pull hues from imagery directly related to the dataset they are visualizing.

                  <p class="big-paragraph"><b>Infinite Line</b> brings the physical artistic process into the visualization generation pipeline by allowing a user to sketch a line segment,
                  upload an image of the sketch, and turn that sketch into a continuous, unbroken, patterned streamline. The output file can be dragged directly into ABR for immediate use.

                  When an artist creates a three-dimensional object, such as a small clay sculpture, they can 3D scan this object and drag it into Glyph Aligner.
                  Glyph Aligner allows users to give this 3D scan a directional quality. The output file can be dragged directly into ABR for immediate use as a glyph.

                    A user may simply take a photo of any surface and upload that photo to texture mapper.
                    The program automatically extracts the texture of the photo and produces a file output that can be dragged directly into ABR for immediate use as a texture for data surfaces in a visualization.
