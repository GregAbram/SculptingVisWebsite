          <p class="big-paragraph">The Arctic is about bridging the distance between the physical
            world and scientific visualization through multiple approachable modalities pulled
            from both the world of art and the world of science. The original project was intended
            as a museum exhibition focused on climate science research conducted in the Arctic and
            featuring a large display screen driven by a touch interface designed for individual or
            small group viewing. Content paths were determined by an underlying system of tags, levels,
            content categories and related research areas. A screen showed a set of images. Each image
            could be accessed to provide image-specific information or could act as a launching pad for
            a new set of related content and images that allows the user to continue on their exploration
            journey. Each person created a unique path through hundreds of pieces of climate content.
            Embedded assessments logged basic demographics of each individual that interacted with the work.
            Each participant was able to plot their own path through the complex science, moving through
            the content at the pace and level of detail that best enabled them to engage with the material. </p>

          <h2>Immersive Exhibit</h2>
          <p>The project has grown with the Sculpting Vis collaborative to incorporate
            new tools and research directions. The ongoing focus of this project is
            physical + digital immersive spaces that allow visitors to interact with
            data, imagery, poetry, and both human and natural artifacts to draw
            connections within and between their everyday lives and the devastating
            effects of rapid climate change on the other side of the planet.

            The team is interested in using low-cost materials to produce engaging and immersive experiences with climate data. </p>

          <h2>Planetariums</h2>
          <p>In partnership with [XX planetarium in Minnesota] and [XX planetarium in New Mexico], the Sculpting Vis collaborative is working to translate mult-modal interactive data visualizations and our Artifact-Based Rendering software for use in public planetariums and science museums around the country. The group seeks to engage diverse audiences in new and imaginative forms of interactive exploration of large, complex, and often inaccessible datasets in equally large and immersive spaces to increase broader impacts and to better understand how to break down the barrier between research and public-facing content. </p>
