abstract = {Pseudo-coloring is a well-established, fundamental tool for visualizing scientific
data. As the size and density of data grows, increasingly more discriminatory power
is required to extract optimum feature resolution. The environmental community, in
particular, relies heavily on this technology to dissect and interpret a huge variety
of visual data. These scientists often turn to traditional rainbow colormaps, despite
their well-documented deficiencies in rendering dense detail. A popular default, the
desaturated rainbow’s non-monotonically varying luminance range misrepresents data.
Despite increasing overall feature resolution, this variance creates hue simultaneity
and vibration, introducing false artifacts, hindering exploration of swaths of data
and impeding analysis [13, 21, 26]. Drawing on artistic color theory, we hypothesized
the desaturated rainbow could be improved by increasing luminance ranges, decreasing
saturation, and employing hue-cycling to boost discriminatory power. These adjusted
maps exhibit algorithmically corroborated higher feature resolve, a primary objective
of all scientists interviewed, without distorting data in discordant false coloring.
Our studies indicate that our maps are preferred by these domain scientists, thereby
providing a potential alternative for effective, human-centric colormapping.},
