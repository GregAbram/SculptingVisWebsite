abstract = {Data physicalizations (3D printed terrain models, anatomical scans, or even abstract
data) can naturally engage both the visual and haptic senses in ways that are difficult
or impossible to do with traditional planar touch screens and even immersive digital
displays. Yet, the rigid 3D physicalizations produced with today's most common 3D
printers are fundamentally limited for data exploration and querying tasks that require
dynamic input (e.g., touch sensing) and output (e.g., animation), functions that are
easily handled with digital displays. We introduce a novel style of hybrid virtual
+ physical visualization designed specifically to support interactive data exploration
tasks. Working toward a "best of both worlds" solution, our approach fuses immersive
AR, physical 3D data printouts, and touch sensing through the physicalization. We
demonstrate that this solution can support three of the most common spatial data querying
interactions used in scientific visualization (streamline seeding, dynamic cutting
places, and world-in-miniature visualization). Finally, we present quantitative performance
data and describe a first application to exploratory visualization of an actively
studied supercomputer climate simulation data with feedback from domain scientists.},
