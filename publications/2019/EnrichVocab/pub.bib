 abstract={As scientific data grow larger and more complex, an equally rich visual vocabulary is needed to fully articulate its insights. We present a series of images that are made possible by a recent technical development “Artifact-Based Rendering,” a component of our broader effort to create a methodology for scientific visualization that draws on principles of art and design.},
